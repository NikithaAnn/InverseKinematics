#CCDIK Inverse Kinematic
This is a simple Link structure loaded from "Link.bvh". If a different file must be used, please changed the constructor in the line 34 of NGLScene.cpp in src folder of this folder.The Load file in the widget does the loading.

To see the algorithm, one must click the REACH TARGET key and it will display the output when the target is set.

The user is able to toggle between the wireframe and solid view. 


#note to reader
Due to a change in the code I had done before the submission, the display function is broken but the values being printed in the command is the working of the CCD IK algorithm.
If there is a copyerror display, untick the Shadow Build checkbox in the Projects-> Build
